# README

One of the challenges I encountered was gettting bootstraps implimented into rails. I am used to using vue or react for the front end so i did my best to learn how to implement it on the fly and just ran out of time. 

That is also why the data in is on JSON format which can be seen with http://localhost:3000/api/coaches/1 as i did not have time to convert it over to HTML

I was also trying to create a cleaner way to display the data in the code using loops but was not able to finish and get the data in the stucture that i wanted to be able to manipulate it properly
I wanted to have the data in a hash structue like i have hard coaded but done in a more concise way but ran into problems with the time structure and did not have enough time to get it worked out.

I think that the main problem I ran into with the project was that i was over thinking things and possibly making it more complicated than it need to be for the assignment.

I wanted to showcase my problem solving skills and show that I can write good algraithems.
